  <strong>A website built for Asia Pacific University Confession Page</strong>
</p>

APU Confession Page is a website that allows user to confess anonymously. The main idea of developing this website is to facilitate managing the confessions by implementing **Facebook's Graph API**. With that, the admin can post the reviewed confession on the Facebook page with just one click. This will eliminate the need for the admin to interface with Google Sheets and manually post the confessions individually.
