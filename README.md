  <strong>A website built for Asia Pacific University Confession Page</strong>
</p>

APU Confession Page is a website that allows user to confess anonymously. The main idea of developing this website is to facilitate the process of managing the confessions by implementing the **Facebook's Graph API**. With that, the admin can post the reviewed confession on to the Facebook page with just one click. This will eliminate the need for admin to interface with Google Sheets and manually post the confession one by one.
